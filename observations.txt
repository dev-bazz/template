## Actual time to Complete

Time: 19 hours

### breakdown

 -> 4hours for project setup: images, assets , fonts, file structures, etc
 -> 10hours for creating different UI elements and making them responsive on different screens.
 -> 2hours for solving bugs and UI edge cases
 -> 1hour for review of task
 -> 2hours for clean up


## Observations

1. The figma design used a 1680px desktop screen to create desktop screen
this means that in that a client screen size has to be up to 1680px to see the Desktop UI.

Note that a figma design for desktop screen should start from 1440px because that is the most common screen size.
I will scale down the size for common desktop screens (1200px upwards)

2. Some of the images in the figma designs were  cropped with the sharp edge, I would have preferred the full image
 but I was able to undo the cropped image and converted them to Webp format to reduce size and increase page load speed
