## Notes

- You will need to create a file called observations.txt which will have your notes and questions about this evaluation test. Please include estimated time to do this assignment and actual time spent to do this assignment.
- To submit your code/work to us for review, please push the code to the GitHub repo that we provided access to it. Follow the usual workflow of: feature branch (_prefix with your initials and then feature name_) - PR -> develop branch - PR -> main branch. If develop branch is not created already, create it.
- For demo popup use custom JavaScript and not Bootstrap modal. The popup appears whenever you click on a Learn More link.
- Please use your best judgement to style it on all devices so it look good on all devices.
- Follow mobile-first approach.
- To be able to access the design specs, you will need to create your own _free_ Figma account first. You don't need an invitation from us to access it, you just need a Figma account.
- For the purposes of the test, you will submit your work in the form of HTML and SCSS and CSS and JavaScript, however, actual tasks you would be building on WordPress.
- Please use SCSS for the styles and gulp to compile to CSS and JavaScript and minify it.
- Filename should be index.html.
